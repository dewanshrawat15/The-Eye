# The Eye
A small utility python script to keep an eye on your machine.

## Idea
The idea is pretty simple. The main aim is to be sure that no person used your machine while you were away.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7.1
- An active internet connection

## Getting Started
Just open up your ```cmd``` or ```terminal``` and navigate to this directory.
Run:
  - ```python -m venv myvenv```
  - Windows Users run
    - ```myvenv\Scripts\activate```
  - Mac/Linux Users run
    - ```source myvenv/bin/activate```
  - ``` pip install -r requirements.txt```
  - ``` python main.py ```
